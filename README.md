# Sol-1 Microcode Editor for Sol-1 HomebrewCPU Minicomputer System

This is a microcode editor for Sol-1 HomebrewCPU Minicomputer - A complete CPU and Minicomputer built from scratch in 74HC logic, created by Paulo de Tarco Constantino Junior (http://sol-1.org). Sol-1 project is inspired by [Bill Buzbee's work](http://homebrewcpu.com) on the [Magic-1 Minicomputer](http://www.magic-1.org/)

The original computer softwares (bios, kernel, sample assembly language programs, ...) are available at https://github.com/abaffa/SOL1_MiniComputer.

I've written an emulator for software testing that is running at http://sol-1.baffasoft.com.br.

The emulator software is available at https://github.com/abaffa/sol-1_emulator.
